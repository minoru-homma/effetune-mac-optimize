### Streaming Service Setup

To process audio from streaming services (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.):

1. Prerequisites:
   - Install a virtual audio device (e.g., VB Cable, Voice Meeter, or ASIO Link Tool)
   - Configure your streaming service to output audio to the virtual audio device

2. Configuration:
   - Open the EffeTune web app in your browser, or launch the EffeTune desktop app
   - Select the virtual audio device as the input source
     - In Chrome, the first time you open it, a dialog box appears asking you to select and allow audio input
     - In the desktop app, set it up by clicking the Config Audio button in the top right of the screen
   - Start playing music from your streaming service
   - Verify that audio is flowing through EffeTune
   - For more detailed setup instructions, see the [FAQ](docs/faq.md)

### Physical Audio Source Setup

To use EffeTune with CD players, network players, or other physical sources:

- Connect your audio interface to your computer
- Open the EffeTune web app in your browser, or launch the EffeTune desktop app

### Using AB Pipeline Features

1. AB Pipeline Overview:
   - EffeTune can maintain two separate effect pipelines: Pipeline A and Pipeline B
   - At startup, only Pipeline A is loaded; Pipeline B is created when needed
   - All processing, saving, loading, and editing operations work on the currently selected pipeline

2. AB Toggle Button:
   - Located to the right of the Effect Pipeline header
   - Shows "A" by default (Pipeline A active)
   - Click to switch between Pipeline A and Pipeline B
   - If Pipeline B doesn't exist when toggling, Pipeline A's settings are copied to Pipeline B

3. AB Menu (Dropdown Button):
   - Located to the right of the AB toggle button
   - "A → B": Copy Pipeline A settings to Pipeline B and switch to Pipeline B
   - "B → A": Copy Pipeline B settings to Pipeline A and switch to Pipeline A

### Effect Selection and Keyboard Shortcuts

1. Effect Selection Methods:
   - Click on effect headers to select individual effects
   - Hold Ctrl while clicking to select multiple effects
   - Click on empty space in the Pipeline area to deselect all effects

4. In the web app, all effect settings are stored in the URL, making them easy to save and share
5. In the desktop app version, export the settings to an effetune_preset file from the File menu
6. Share the exported effetune_preset file. The effetune_preset file can also be loaded by dragging it into the web app window

### Audio Reset

If you experience audio issues (dropouts, glitches):
1. Click the "Reset Audio" button in the top-left corner on the web app or select Reload from the View menu on the desktop app
2. The audio pipeline will be rebuilt automatically
3. Your effect chain configuration will be preserved

### Frequency Response Measurement and Correction

To measure your audio system's frequency response and create a flat correction EQ:
1. For the web version, launch the [Frequency Response Measurement tool](https://effetune.frieve.com/features/measurement/measurement.html). For the app version, select Frequency Response Measurement from the Settings menu.
2. Follow the guided setup to configure your measurement microphone and output device
3. Measure your system's frequency response at one or more listening positions
4. Generate a parametric EQ correction that can be directly imported into EffeTune
5. Apply the correction to achieve a more accurate, neutral sound reproduction

## Technical Information

### Browser Compatibility

Frieve EffeTune has been tested and verified to work on Google Chrome. The application requires a modern browser with support for:
- Web Audio API
- Audio Worklet
- getUserMedia API
- Drag and Drop API

### Browser Support Details
1. Chrome/Chromium
   - Fully supported and recommended
   - Update to latest version for best performance

2. Firefox/Safari
   - Limited support
   - Some features may not work as expected
   - Consider using Chrome for best experience

### Recommended Sample Rate

For optimal performance with nonlinear effects, it is recommended to use EffeTune at a sample rate of 96kHz or higher. This higher sample rate helps achieve ideal characteristics when processing audio through nonlinear effects such as saturation and compression.
